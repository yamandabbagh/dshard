# dynamic-sharding
This is a dynamic sharding implementation using the IoTeX protocol.

## Motivation
But first why do we need blockchain for the IoT? The current IoT systems face 3 main limitations: first scalability based on cisco predictions the number of devices is expected to reach 50b by 2022 which would cause a scalabilty problem for the current server system. Privacy is another concern with few compnaies in control of all the data collected by IoT devices, last but not least the support for coopertation between devices of multiple brands is diffecult to acheive.
